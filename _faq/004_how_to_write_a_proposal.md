question: "How do I write a good proposal?"
order: 4
---

We have some notes you should keep in mind for your proposal:

* First check if there's an idea you like on this page.
* Get in touch with the mentors mentioned in this idea to get into this topic and get answers to your questions.
* Define - maybe together with the mentor - some measurable milestones, so you can design a rough timetable.
* Refine and break down your milestones (maybe into stories), also together with the mentor.
* Try to estimate what stories you can work on within the GSoC period. Please keep in mind that we have 2 kinds of projects: full-time with 350 hours and half-time with 175 hours over 10 weeks.
* Use our application template to introduce yourself and describe your project. The resulting document you should upload to the Google Summer of Code program website.
