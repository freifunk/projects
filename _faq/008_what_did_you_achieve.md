We attended Google Summer of Code first in 2009. Over 15 years, we completed a lot of valuable projects, won many new contributors and community members that help us to grow and continue our work.

You can find a list of completed projects since 2020 at our [completed projects page](https://projects.freifunk.net/#/completed).

Our contributors have also written blog posts about their GSoC experiences. You can read all GSoC-related blog posts at [blog.freifunk.net/tag/gsoc/](https://blog.freifunk.net/tag/gsoc/).
