question: "What are the different project sizes (90h, 175h, 350h)?"
order: 10
---
Google Summer of Code offers three project sizes, which are defined by Google:

* **Small projects**: 90 hours over 10 weeks
* **Medium projects**: 175 hours over 10 weeks  
* **Large projects**: 350 hours over 10 weeks

The project size is determined by the scope and complexity of the work. When you look at our project ideas, each project will indicate its size. You should choose a project size that matches your availability and the project's requirements.

The hours should be distributed evenly over the 10-week coding period, or you can discuss a different schedule with your mentor. Projects can also be extended or completed faster if needed, but this should be coordinated with your mentor.

Please refer to [Google's official documentation](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#project-sizes) for the most current information about project sizes and stipends.
