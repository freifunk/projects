During Google Summer of Code, we have several expectations for our contributors:

**Time Commitment:**
* Hours should be distributed evenly over the 10-week coding period, or coordinated with your mentor
* Projects can be extended or completed faster if needed, but this should be discussed with your mentor

**Communication:**
* Regular updates to your mentor (at least one meeting per week is the minimum expectation)
* Active participation in community discussions
* Regular communication about progress, challenges, and questions

**Blog Posts:**
We expect three blog posts during the program:
* **Beginning**: An introductory post about yourself and your project
* **Midterm**: A midterm evaluation post summarizing your progress
* **Final**: A final blog post describing what you achieved

**Meetings:**
* Regular one-on-one meetings with your mentor (schedule to be discussed personally)
* Participation in joint meetings with all GSoC projects (these are organized for all contributors)

**Code Quality:**
* Write clean, well-documented code
* Include tests where appropriate
* Follow the project's coding standards and best practices
* Respond to code review feedback promptly

**Community Engagement:**
* Be respectful and collaborative
* Ask questions when you need help
* Share your knowledge and experiences
