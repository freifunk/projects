question: "What if I'm not selected for GSoC?"
order: 15
---
Not being selected for Google Summer of Code doesn't mean you can't contribute to our projects!

**You can still contribute:**
* All our projects are open source and welcome contributions
* You can work on issues, submit pull requests, and participate in discussions
* Many contributors started without GSoC and became valuable community members

**Important difference:**
* If you contribute outside of GSoC, you cannot expect formal mentoring
* Our mentors volunteer their time specifically for GSoC participants
* We don't have the capacity to provide structured mentoring for all contributors

**Other opportunities:**
* You can apply again next year if you're still eligible
* Some projects have other mentorship programs or initiatives
* Contributing now will strengthen your application for future GSoC rounds

**Getting started:**
* Check out our [projects page](https://projects.freifunk.net/#/projects) for open issues
* Join our [community channels](https://projects.freifunk.net/#/faq/007_how_to_get_in_touch_with_the_community) to introduce yourself
* Start with small contributions to get familiar with the codebase
