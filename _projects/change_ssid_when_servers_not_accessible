name: Change SSID when servers are not accessible
desc: In larger installations there will be many routers at different parts of a building on different channels, and one these may not be able to reach to the project's servers, and consequently also not issue IP numbers.
  Users changing their location may interpret this as an instability of the Freifunk and not attempt to fix what may be a loose cable on their side.
  The routers should change their SSID to an indication that it needs help.

In larger installations there will be many routers at different parts of a building on different channels, and one these may not be able to reach to the project's servers, and consequently also not issue IP numbers.
Users changing their location may interpret this as an instability of the Freifunk and not attempt to fix what may be a loose cable on their side.
The routers should change their SSID to an indication that it needs help, so local organisers can find the issue earlier and error reports improve.
The meshing between routers should not be affected.

This project idea is not new, above shows a respective suggestion from the community. But yet no solution has been integrated with the regular Freifunk images.
The solution from 2016 may stimulate a better implementation. 

#### Milestones

##### GSOC COMMUNITY BONDING

* Conceptual work should be finished.
* The contributor have a repository, know how to work with the community.
* The applicant should know the community.

##### GSOC MIDTERM

* Everything listed here has to be reviewed and merged by midterm.
* No exceptions to that. Changing the goals is possible together with mentors.
* Yes, that includes tests and documentation.

##### GSOC FINAL

* Everything has to be reviewed and merged.
* Including tests and docs, again.
