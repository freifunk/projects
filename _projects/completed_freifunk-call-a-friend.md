During [GSOC 2018](https://blog.freifunk.net/2018/08/14/meshenger-p2p-local-network-messenger-final-update/) we developed an App called [Meshenger](https://github.com/meshenger-app/) to audio/video call people over mesh networks without any servers. Pure Peer-to-Peer without federation servers or discovery servers. The App can be used e.g. in [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/), [Libremesh](https://libremesh.org/) networks and typical LANs or overlay networks. Meshenger is the only App out there known to us that works in these scenarios.

Meshenger users exchange a name, crypto keys and IP/MAC address via QR-Code and then call an IP address to establish a Audio/Video call. This is already working, but keep reading.

This App was quite a success and is available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/d.d.meshenger/).

Since back then a few features (cryptography, call list, block list, lots of bugfixes) were added. But there was never a release, since calling is broken/fragile in the development branch. The reason is unknown.
Meshenger is for the most part the [WebRTC Android example](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/+/refs/heads/main/examples/androidapp/) with added features. This should give you a solid guideline.

The task for this project would be to fix the current state (possibly up- or downgrading WebRTC) to get a new release out of the door. A highly motivated person might event want to switch the project to Kotlin. The mentor(s) will support with understanding the code and inner working of the App throughout the project.

This is an effort to create something that can be used across the globe for many small communities.

Many aspects of this project are up for the discussion. If you are interested, but unsure, then feel free to contact the mentor(s) beforehand. It is welcome and shows initiative (moritzwarning@web.de). :-)

#### Milestones

##### GSoC Preparation/Bonding

* Let's talk about the current state of project.
* Talking about the outline of the project.
* Maybe visit the Battlemesh (depends on covid and date&location).

##### GSOC Start

* Plan steps to create a release.
* Decide on features to add or remove.
* Get to know the code with sessions with mentor(s)

##### GSOC Midterm

* Testing and fixing.

##### GSOC Final

* Make a release and add reap the Karma
