During 2019 GSoC session, the framework for the Web interface of retroshare was first initiated and developed.
The  Web interface is made in Javascript and uses Retroshare automated JSON API interface to communicate with the
internals of libretroshare. It already has its own building system and already works, although it is rather incomplete.

The work in this project consists in developing the remaining Javascript code to complete the Web interface, which
includes the configuration panel, the access to channels, forums and boards, as well as the handling of GXS identities.
A plus would also be to add a panel for statistics, showing various aspects of the internal variables of file transfer,
GXS synchronisation, so that the software can easily be run on a headless server.

Although this project is fairly easy, it requires some reasonable knowledge of JS. The project do not aim to changing
the current framework the Web interface is based on, nor its internal algorithmics. There is no specific order in which the
different aspects of the Web interface can be covered by the candidate. A proof of involvement (a few commits fixing
simple issues) will be requested in order to select motivated applicants.
