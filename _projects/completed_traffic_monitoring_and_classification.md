Today's network incorporate a wide range of different devices such as laptops, smartphones, IoT devices such as cleaning robots etc. However, the devices might come with different requirement in terms of throughput, connections, latency etc. The goal is to leverage XDP [1] and/or eBPF [2] for the analysis and classification of traffic to perform optimization for the transmission rate control running in the mac80211 subsystem of the Linux Kernel or to built the foundation for networking research such as detecting malicious behavior of devices.

The goal of this project is, to realize traffic monitoring and classification mechanisms via XDP/eBPF that can leverage XDP/eBPF to run within the Linux Kernel on OpenWrt devices [3]. This would enable optimization such as passing the knowledge directly to the transmission rate control to optimize the selected rates, sampling, and latency to the transmission power control. Moverover, the approach should also allow to provide the foundation for further research in the direction of network research.
