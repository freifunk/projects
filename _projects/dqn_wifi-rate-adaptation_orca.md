The goal of MAC-layer Wi-Fi rate adaptation (RA) is to dynamically select modulation and coding scheme (MCS) rate parameters for the transmission of frames to optimize throughput given a varying channel. Conventional Wi-Fi RA algorithms rely on heuristics from older IEEE 802.11 amendments, which can struggle in denser, more complex networks. As Wi-Fi environments become more crowded, machine learning techniques, especially reinforcement learning (RL), are gaining attention for their potential to improve rate selection [3].

RL addresses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by continuously exploring actions and exploiting the best-performing ones. This dynamic approach can adapt to real-time network conditions, optimizing throughput, and improving overall performance. Unlike traditional heuristics, RL can evolve, offering a more flexible and robust solution for modern Wi-Fi networks. However, even with the promising potential of applying RL-based approaches for WiFi RA, there are limited investigations that offer an in-depth performance evaluation for real IEEE 802.11 networks using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware.

The objective of this project is to investigate the use of Deep Q Networks (DQN) for Wi-Fi RA. In [2], R. Queir√≥s et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of a DQN-based RA algorithm in an IEEE 802.11n network through simulation. Building on this work, this project aims to extend the algorithm for the IEEE 802.11ac standard, which involves a relatively larger action space. The implemented algorithm will be evaluated using an experimental toolchain based on the Open-source Resource Control API (ORCA) [1] which enables user space implementation of novel WiFi RA algorithms and their comparison. ORCA is a kernel-user space API for the Linux-based OpenWrt OS. Performance evaluation will include comparing the DQN-based RA algorithm and variants of Minstrel-HT based on metrics such as throughput.
