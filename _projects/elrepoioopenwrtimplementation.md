[ElRepo.io](https://elrepo.io) is a decentralized repository of culture built on RetroShare API client.
The actual app is developed with Flutter and supports Android systems.

ElRepolib library is written on pure Dart language and could be ported to ARM devices with some Research.
And what about Flutter framework?

A future implementation for elRepo.io is living on routers or other embed devices improving shared
networks experience, being a place where exchange any type of media or text.
