Incorporating active Transmit Power Control (TPC) through a TPC algorithm holds the potential to optimize WiFi networks by intelligently adjusting transmit power for various clients. This adaptive approach reduces interference and enhances overall network throughput, utilizing potential spatial reuse, especially in high-density WiFi environments. Additionally, It is essential for TPC to be supported by 802.11h-compliant WiFi devices, enabling higher TX power levels under specific circumstances, notably adhering to regulatory limits in certain channels.

Past attempts to implement a TPC algorithm relied on the TX status information to obtain information on the used transmission power which work with older WiFi chips like IEEE802.11n AR9xxx or IEEE 802.11ac mt7615. However, as the industry shifts towards closed-source firmware from the IEEE802.11ax standard onward and embraces FullMAC architectures in WiFi chips, there's a need for a more forward-looking solution.

To address this challenge, the proposal advocates for developing a new approach which works as a simplified wifi firmware to Linux driver interface, sidestepping the dependence on extra reporting features.The algorithm will instead focus on capabilities that permit annotating different power levels per connected station and dynamically adjust the TX power limit per station based on the available information about current throughput.

The goal of this project is to initially implement a novel TPC algorithm in the user space and then in the mac80211 subsystem of the Linux Kernel. The evaluation will be conducted in real-world scenarios, specifically on productive Freifunk Mesh and Access deployments.
